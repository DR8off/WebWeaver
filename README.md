# Web Weaver v0.0.1
Visit here https://dr8off.github.io/WebWeaver/
A web-based code editor that allows you to write HTML, CSS and JS code. The application features a split-screen view where you can see the live result of your code in real-time. 
The app is still in development and is awaiting your support via github stars. Every star motivates me to finish the project for free use.
